GitHub Repository: Basic Image Processing Examples
This repository contains basic image processing examples using OpenCV in Python. The examples provided are intended for individuals who are new to image processing and would like to get started with simple image manipulation techniques. The repository includes the following files:

File 1: 1.smoothing image.py
This file demonstrates various smoothing techniques applied to an input image.

File 2: 2.thresholding image.py
This file demonstrates different thresholding techniques applied to a grayscale image.

File 3: 3.morph image.py

This file demonstrates different morphological operations applied to a grayscale image.

Note: The repository also includes two image files (apple.png and morph.png) that are used as input for the examples.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the provided image processing techniques. Have fun learning!
