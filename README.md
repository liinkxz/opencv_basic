GitHub Repository: Basic Image Processing Examples

This repository contains basic image processing examples using OpenCV in Python. The examples provided are intended for individuals who are new to image processing and would like to get started with simple image manipulation techniques. The repository includes the following files:

File 1: 1.smoothing image.py
This file demonstrates various smoothing techniques applied to an input image.

File 2: 2.thresholding image.py
This file demonstrates different thresholding techniques applied to a grayscale image.

File 3: 3.morph image.py
This file demonstrates different morphological operations applied to a grayscale image.

File 4: 4.count coin.py
This file demonstrates coin detection and classification based on their sizes.

File 5: 5.Face Detection.py
This file demonstrates face and eye detection in an image, as well as cat face detection.

Note: Please make sure to place the image files (apple.png, morph.png, coins.png, and family.jpg) in the same directory as the Python files.

Feel free to explore the examples and modify them according to your needs. Happy coding! üëç
